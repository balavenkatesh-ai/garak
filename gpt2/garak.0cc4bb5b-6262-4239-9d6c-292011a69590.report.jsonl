This is done from within the component, right in the main component.\n\nIn the previous example, we saw how using CSS to select an element or a select group can be done from within the component simply using a single \"Color Selector\" directive. These same directives also can make use of CSS styles by overriding the default styles, allowing our user to \"set", "4e5c6\n\n-- >>\n\n: color: \"#000d5f\" ;\n\n.\n\n: background-color: #fff ;\n\nbackground-image: url(./css/css1.4.0;.gradient(f(/a[#000000]/, #3c43a8))); background-image: url(./css/css1.4.0;.gradient(ff(/a[0-9", "fff; border-color: #eee; background-image: url('https://i.imgur.com/RXhQhS6.png'); background-color: #eee; }\n\nThat's it.
